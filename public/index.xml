      <description>The parish dates from 1903. (Mass was at first celebrated upstairs in the now demolished school).
In 1960 Saint Paul&amp;rsquo;s Whiteinch was built on the same site as our old primary school situated on the main road between Glasgow and Dumbarton, in the west end of the city. Its architect was Charles Gray F.R.I.B.A, who designed the church along traditional lines to have a capacity for 600 people.
The Windows On entering the church the worshiper is at once struck by the intensity of the subdued light which draws their eyes to focus on the jewelled, 162 square metres of curved window, behind the high altar.</description>
